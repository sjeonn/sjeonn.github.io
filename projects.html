                1. this website -- completely from scratch, baby! <br>
                I'm sure there are better ways to do this, but tbh I'm still kinda new at this,
                and this was a really good learning experience.

                2. At the moment, I'm teaching myself web development since that wasn't something
                that was really covered in depth in any of my classes or my org work. 
                Currently working through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>
                and having a great time!
            </p>
            <p>Here are some my Odin Project projects:</p>
